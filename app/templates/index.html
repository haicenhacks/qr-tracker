  <p>
    If you have reached this page, you have scanned a QR code that you found somewhere.
    This is part of an information security experiment.
    None of your personal data has been collected, beyond what is sent to any website you visit.
    This page and the QR code you scanned are not dangerous, but others could be.
  </p>
  <p>
    QR codes could be used in "phishing" attacks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing</a>
    Instead of this page, you could have asked for login information that could be used to steal information.

    My hope is that this will remind people to treat QR codes the same as random links sent via email.

    The code that powers this page is available on < a href="https://github.com/haicenhacks/qr-tracker">github</a>.
